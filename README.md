## Efficient SFTP Testing with JSch, Kotlin, Testcontainers, and Spring Boot Native

Explore a streamlined approach to testing SFTP operations using JSch, Kotlin, Testcontainers,
and the power of Spring Boot Native for optimized performance.

2. [JSCH testing and TestContainers Howto](doc/Testing.md)
3. [Going Native Howto](doc/Native.md)
4. [Tests containers, going further](doc/TODO)

## Conclusions

In conclusion, we have covered the various steps to use JSch for sending and receiving files with an SSH/SFTP server.

We have set up a test using TestContainers to dynamically spin up a Docker image that served as our server for
conducting our send/receive tests.

We used GraalVM and native compilation to improve the performance of our app.
